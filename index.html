    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <p>Musk became a millionaire in 1999 at age 27 when he sold Zip2 (his web-software company) for over $340 million. With a 7% share of the company, Musk received $22 million for the deal.

He reached billionaire-status in 2012 at age 40, debuting on Forbes Billionaires List with a net worth of $2 billion.

        He was so quiet as a child that his parents thought he was deaf. 

It’s been reported that Musk read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica by age nine. Musk taught himself to write computer code at the age of 12 and created a video game called Blastar, which he ended up selling for $500 to PC and Office Technology magazine.

 Musk was bullied as a kid.

Musk was the youngest and smallest boy in his class, and he was often bullied. He ended up in the hospital once after a group of boys pushed him down a flight of stairs and said he was “almost beaten to death” on one occasion.

As a result, he learned karate, judo and wrestling at age 15.</p>
